**WARNING**: This is the development branch for the third version of Inter.

Inter is a Javascript framework designed to build highly interactive front-end web applications.
It's: **simple**, **intuitive** and **powerful**.


# No complex setup

You will not need to do any complex configuration to start working with Inter, just import the
framework in top of your page in a script tag, and start building even the most complex web apps.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/interjs/inter/inter.min.js"></script>
```

# Small

It does not mean that it is less capable, it means that it is easy to learn and cheaper to parse and download.

# You rarely touch in the *DOM*

Almost every dom manipulation in an Inter app are handled by Inter, you  must just focus in your application logic, this way your code base will be: **simpler** and **more maintainable**

# Reactivity

*Inter* is super reactive, it means that, when there's a change it just updates the necessary part of the interface.

# Compatibility

*Inter* just supports the modern browsers, it means that no Internet Explorer support.

# License

*Inter* was realesed under the MIT LICENSE.

# Guide
